## Walking in Square

- My approach for this problem involved having the robot go in a forward direction for a fixed amount of time before turning for a fixed amount of time until it reached approximately 90 degrees and repeating this behavior 4 times before stopping.
- My code was all written within one class called SquareWalk. This class had an *__init__* method and a *run* method. The *__init__* initialized the node and publisher to cmd_vel, while the *run* method contained the meat of the code involving what was described above. Within *run*, I first defined the Twist velocities for my three states: forward, turning, and stopping. Then, I wrote the loop that published going forward followed by sleeping for a fixed time followed by turning and sleeping before repeating. Finally, I set Turtlebot to 0 velocity before escaping.
Here is what it looks like after running:

- My biggest challenges were making sure my publisher was connected before trying to set the right values for my velocity. At first, my publisher did not get connected in time, and the turtlebot remained stationary, but I remedied this by having a while loop that checked to make sure my publisher was connected before executing any commands. My second challenge involved setting the correct velocities. At first, I set the velocities too large and the turtlebot would move quite sporadically. Then, I set the velocities to less than 1 for both the angular and linear velocity and my robot moved correctly. To get it to turn correctly, I had to set the angular z velocity when at first I was trying to set the angular x velocity. I also just experimented around with values starting from the fact that pi/2 radians is about 1.6 and with a speed of 0.2 rad/sec, I should turn around 8 secs.
- If I had more time, I would instead use the /odom topic to ensure that the robot was turning exactly 90 degrees at each turn because I do think my turns could be a little more accurate.
- My key takeaways are that I need to check to make sure that all publishers and subscribers are connected before trying to use them. I feel that I could run into a bug easily where I expect the robot to move or a value to be read, but not get the correct outcome due to not connecting. Additionally, I learned that lower values for velocity are favored to get the robot to perform actions precisely. When I put in values over 1, the robot seemed to sometimes move in less straight paths and it was difficult to coordinate turning correctly.
